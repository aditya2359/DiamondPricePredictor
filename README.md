## Machine Learning Project
This Project Aims to predict the price of diamond based on its attributes,using Linear Regression models. We employed the regularization method to predict the price of diamond out of which lasso regression model(L1) provides the highest accuracy of 93.689% out of all the regularization techniques, in predicting the price of diamond.
